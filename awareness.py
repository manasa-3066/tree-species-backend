### 🔬 శాస్త్రీయ మరియు భౌతిక లక్షణాలు
మాంగ్రోవ్ అనేది ఒకే చెట్టు కాదు; ఇది *Rhizophora, Avicennia, Sonneratia* వంటి అనేక వృక్ష జాతుల సమాహారం.  
ఈ చెట్లకు గాలిలోకి పైకి వచ్చిన ప్రత్యేక వేర్లు (Stilt roots, Pneumatophores) ఉంటాయి, ఇవి మట్టి లోపల ఆక్సిజన్ లేకపోయినా శ్వాస తీసుకోవడానికి సహాయపడతాయి. ఉప్పు నీటిని తట్టుకునే ప్రత్యేక సామర్థ్యం మాంగ్రోవ్ చెట్లకు ఉంది.
